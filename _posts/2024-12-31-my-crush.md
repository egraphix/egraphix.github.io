&emsp; There’s something deeply unsettling about uncertainty. It gnaws at you, makes you question your instincts, and leaves you in a tug-of-war between logic and emotion. I’ve always prided myself on being strong, logical, and in control. But when it comes to feelings—raw, unfiltered emotions—it’s like stepping into a storm without an umbrella. No matter how prepared I think I am, I always end up soaked. <!--more--> <br>

Recently, I found myself in one of these storms. A crush. Someone whose presence felt magnetic, but whose actions often felt like a puzzle I couldn’t quite solve. I don’t know how it started at first. Then came the avoidance. And because I hate losing control, I matched it, doubled it, made sure they knew I was pulling away on purpose. It was petty, maybe, but it protected my ego. Yet, like all storms, the tension eventually eased, leaving me wondering if I had misread everything or simply overreacted.<br>

That’s the thing about feelings—they don’t follow the rules. No matter how much I try to analyze or predict, they spill over the edges of logic, refusing to stay contained. And yet, here I was, standing at a crossroads, trying to make a decision: Should I give it a try, risking my heart and ego, or lean into the path I’ve always known was meant for me? <br>


&emsp;**glimpse** <br>
&emsp;When I caught his glimpse. It was so brief, so unassuming, yet in that moment, I felt the butterflies. The kind that takes over before you can stop it, reminding you that maybe, just maybe, you feel something real.
But almost as soon as I felt it, a voice inside asked: So what’s next?

Part of me told myself to stay grounded, to not let this moment of fluttering feelings unravel the plans I’ve worked so hard to create. After all, I’m going to leave in two years. Why risk my ego, my heart, and my dreams for something so uncertain?

Yet another part of me wanted to hold onto that glimpse, as if it were something precious. What if this is it? it whispered. What if this fleeting moment is worth holding onto?

It’s a battle between logic and emotion—between the side of me that wants to lean in and the side that knows I can’t, not when the future I’m building lies beyond this so called “feeling”.


&emsp;**the past** <br>
&emsp;Still, I struggle. Maybe it’s because I’ve been hurt before. There was someone who once gave me the world—the most romantic gestures, words that felt like poetry—and then shattered my heart in a way I didn’t think was possible.

Now, when I look at this crush, I can’t help but see the shadows of that past. They even share the same birth year, as if fate is playing some cruel trick on me. So, I tell myself: Don’t risk it. Protect yourself. Stay in control.

But staying in control isn’t as easy as it sounds, not when feelings have already made their way past the walls I built.

&emsp;**wake up, girl** <br>
&emsp;Sometimes, I think I need someone to scold me. Not to hurt me, but to give me the wake-up call I’m too scared to give myself. If that someone were here, they’d say:
“Wake up. You're here for bigger things-your dreams, your goals, your self-respect.”
And you know what? They’d be right. I’ve been through enough to know that people who want to be in your life will make it clear—they won’t make you feel like you’re chasing them or questioning their intentions. And I’m better than reaction. I’m better than sitting in the gray zone of “what if.”

&emsp;**the bigger** <br>
&emsp;Here’s the thing: I have dreams bigger than this feeling, bigger than the confusion and avoidance. I want to be someone who goes out into the world and makes an impact. Someone who fights against inequalities, helps people whose voices often go unheard, and builds something meaningful. That’s the life I’m reaching for—a life where I take risks, not just for love, but for something meaningful. 

So when I sit here, caught in the web of “should I or shouldn’t I,” I can’t help but ask myself: Is this helping me grow? Is this bringing me closer to the person I aspire to be? Or am I just stuck, letting the weight of uncertainty hold me back from stepping into something that feels so elusive—the dream I’ve been searching for?

&emsp;**letting go** <br>
&emsp;Letting go isn’t about closing my heart. It’s about opening it to the bigger picture. It’s about choosing the version of myself who doesn’t get stuck in the past or hold onto what could have been. It’s about trusting that if something is truly meant for me, it won’t feel this heavy or uncertain.

So, I’m choosing to step away—not because my feelings weren’t real, but because my dreams are stronger. I’ll carry the memory of those fleeting moments, not as regret, but as a reminder that I can feel deeply and still choose to rise above it.

&emsp;**next** <br>
&emsp;So, here’s to moving forward. Here’s to saying goodbye—not just to them, but to the “what ifs” that keep me looking back. Here’s to choosing my dreams over fleeting glances and fleeting feelings.
So, here’s to stepping away, not as a loss, but as a choice. Here’s to choosing my dreams over my doubts. And here’s to believing that what’s meant for me will find me on the other side of this journey.

 At the end of the day, I’m not afraid of storms—I’m afraid of standing still.
